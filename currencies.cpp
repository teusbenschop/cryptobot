 Question:
 Will it not be better to make automatic coin management for the exchanges that have hundreds of coins?
 That would save the weekly hassle of coin updates.
 Suggestion would be to include the age of "last seen" of the coin.
 If there's coins that have last been seen at some time,
 and there's coins that's older as to their 'last seen" status, these older ones definitely can be removed.
 This is to cater for exchange communiation erors.
 Tis applies to Bittrex, Cryptopia and TradeSatoshi and Yobit.
 Answer:
 It would have made sense in the past more than now.
 Because now the bot does arbitrage on the best of coins.
 So new coins are very unlikely to soon rise to the status of being among the best of coins.
 So no longer it is needed to do weekly coin updates.
 Once in a while, that would be enough.
