// This is the satellite server.
// It serves the market summaries, the buyers, and the sellers, via http.

// The initial reason for having this server is as follows:
// The bot was going to use more and more CPU.
// So there was a need to rent a more powerful virtual server.
// Or to put a dedicated server in a datacenter.
// Since the bot is not a public server that should be online all of the time,
// it made sense to put the bot on a server at home.
// That would be less expensive than putting the bot on a server in a datacenter.
// But the problem with this approach was that the server used a lot of data
// when downloading the market summaries and the rates.
// That is when the plan came up to leave the part that uses a lot of data in the cloud,
// and move the bot itself, that requires a lot of CPU power, to a server at home.
// So the bot at home fetches the rates from the online server.
// The online rates server receives a lot of bytes from the various exchanges,
// strips out whatever is not needed, and then server the data in bare form to the bot.
// This way the data usage of the bot at home is reduced a lot.

// Through the libcurl option VERBOSE,
// it can be seen that there's a huge lot of data being transferred for a single call,
// because it is HTTPS,
// and other stuff is added.
// So if using the satellite, it saves a huge lot of data to the main bot.

// Library libcurl is using a lot of CPU.
// When using this satellite, the CPU usage of libcurl is offloaded to that satellite.

// Initially the server was left running continually.
// But then it happened that the Bitfinex websocket connection got stuck.
// So it kept giving the same rates, and limit trade orders kept being placed.
// This led to the wrong arbitrage trading.
// So now the server is started at the start of every minute.
// It quits on its own just before the end of every minute.

// If there are connection issues while switching to the next satellite,
// a possible solution would be this:
// Two satellites both running at different ports.
// If a satellite on one port starts, it signals the one on the other port, to shut down.
// It does not shut down straightwawy.
// It gives a different response to the heartbeat, so the clients know to use another satellite.
// The satellite shuts down after a few minutes.
// The bot will have switched already to the second satellite.

// The bot used to get the order books through various proxy servers.
// It now get the same information through this satellite.
// The number of succeeded hurried calls to get the order books has improved a lot now.
// The failed hurried call count is now low or zero.
// This may also be related to the 10+ IPv6 global addresses per satellite.
// The former proxy server had only one IPv6 address.
